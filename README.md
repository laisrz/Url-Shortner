# URL Shortner

Let's build our own URL shortening service. Think bit.ly or tinyurl.com services.

Basically it is a service that let people turn long and confuse URLs in nice and short URLs that are easy to share.

## Requirements

We need to let people enter the URL somewhere. For this, we need an API endpoint that accepts a URL and returns a short URL. People should be able to:

* Shorten a URL
* Delete a URL
* Update a URL
* Retrieve a URL
