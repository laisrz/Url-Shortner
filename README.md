# URL Shortner

Let's build our own URL shortening service. Think bit.ly or tinyurl.com services.

Basically it is a service that let people turn long and confuse URLs in nice and short URLs that are easy to share.

## Requirements

We need to let people enter the URL somewhere. For this, we need an API endpoint that accepts a URL and returns a short URL. People should be able to:

* Shorten a URL
* Delete a URL
* Update a URL
* Retrieve a URL

## Technologies Used

* Flask
* PonyORM/MySQL

## API Endpoints

- `GET "/"`- to access the homepage with instructions on how to perform all available operations in the API: shorten, delete,
update and retrieve an url
- `POST "/"`- to provide information in order to shorten an url. Returns the shortened url
- `GET "/<short_url>"` - to get the original url from the shortened url
- `PUT "/"` - to update a shortened url to point to a different long url
- `DELETE "/"` - to delete a shortened url

## Setup Instructions

  ### Configure a Virtual Environment
  * Make sure you have pip installed. The Python installers for Windows include pip, but you can confirm
    you have the latest version:

        py -m pip install --upgrade pip
        py -m pip --version 

  * Now, you'll need to create a virtual environment. In the project’s directory run:

    Windows:
    
        py -m venv env

    Unix/macOS:
    
        python3 -m venv env

  * Activate the virtual environment:
    
    Windows:
    
        .\env\Scripts\activate

    Unix/macOS:
    
        source env/bin/activate
    
  ### Install dependencies

  In Windows, run:
  
          py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

  In Unix/macOS:
  
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

  ### Setup MYSQL Server
  
  1. Download XAMPP (software tool that handles MySQL administration over the web):
        https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
  2. Start the following two processes once XAMPP has been installed and loaded:
       * Apache
       * MySQL
  3. Go to https://localhost in your browser and click on phpMyAdmin on the upper right.
  4. Create a new database named: "urlshortener"
  5. Go to the project's directory and open the file db_config.py on the database module. 
        Update the information of the user and password of the mysql database.

  ## Run the Application

  1. Start the Flask development server, by running, in the project’s directory:

         flask run
     
  3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the URL Shortener.
